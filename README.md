# Customers pix movements Power BI dashboard

### This is a Power BI dashboard created with the aim of using the views created in the [dbt_analytics](https://github.com/TiagoBHeck/dbt_analytics) project.

## Objective

#### This dashboard aims to highlight some of the most important features present in Power BI and also present how a data analysis project can be built starting from data extraction, creation of personalized views (using DBT) and import of the data model (view) into BI.
